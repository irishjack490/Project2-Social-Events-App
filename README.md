## Project 2 - Fun Events Tracker

This is a fun app where a user can track upcoming events

## User Stories

For privacy reasons, the user should only have access to the group's information if logged in. As a user I should be able to do the following:
    "*" Log in 
    "*"Have a rendered view of all the fun events coming up
    "*"Have the capability of see check boxes to choose if they are interested and/or attending
    "*Have the capability to see specific details about the event and get a link to buy tickets
    "*"Have the choice to delete events from their "my events" page 
    "*" Have the capability to update the interest or attendance options on the events
    "*" Log out
