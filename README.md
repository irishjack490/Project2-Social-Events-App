## Project 2 - Fun Events Tracker

This is a fun app that a group of friends can use as a platform to post fun events around town. The user can view the event, the location and the details. This app is meant to help a group of individuals to stay connected and keep the friendship going. 

## User Stories

For privacy reasons, the user should only have access to the group's information if logged in. As a user I should be able to do the following:
    "*" Log in 
    "*"Have a rendered view of all the fun events coming up
    "*"Have the capability of saving favorite events and displaying it to another page
    "*"Add a friend that is also a user of the app 
    "*"Have the choice to comment on events where other users can see the comments 
    "*" Log out
